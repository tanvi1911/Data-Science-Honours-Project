## Project Overview

The **Heart Disease Prediction Web App** is a machine learning-powered application that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical factors. It utilizes a Naive Bayes classification model trained on a dataset of heart health data.

This project is part of my final year IT engineering honors project and demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning in the field of healthcare.


## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web app offers an intuitive interface where users can input their medical information.

- **Predictive Model:** The core of the application is a Naive Bayes classification model, which has been trained on a large dataset of heart health records to make accurate predictions.

- **Interactive Explanations:** Users can access explanations for various medical terms, ensuring they understand the significance of each input field.

- **Live Demo:** You can experience the web app firsthand through the [live demo](https://tanvi1911-data-science-honours-project-app-vhrsuu.streamlit.app/).

## Conclusion

The **Heart Disease Prediction Web App** represents a significant step forward in utilizing machine learning and data science to address a critical healthcare issue. The project leverages a Naive Bayes classification model to provide users with a convenient tool for estimating their risk of heart disease.
